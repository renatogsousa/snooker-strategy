# snooker-strategy
Snooker strategy app based on probabilities
Created to simulate snooker match/frames based on players statistics.
Defined 5 levels of shot difficulty (1-easiest, 5-hardest).
Then each player has a profile with:
- pot success (for each shot difficulty level)
- offensive (probability to try to pot (as opposed to try a safety play, depending on shot difficulty level)
- cue ball control (probability to control cue ball for next shot, depending  on current shot difficulty level)
- safety (probability to have a success safety play when not trying to pot a ball)
